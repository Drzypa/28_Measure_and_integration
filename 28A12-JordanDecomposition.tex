\begin{document}
\PMlinkescapeword{decomposition}
Let $(\Omega,\mathscr{S},\mu)$ be a signed measure space, and let $(A,B)$ be a Hahn decomposition for $\mu$. We define $\mu^+$ and $\mu^-$ by 
\[\mu^+(E) = \mu(A\cap E)\quad \mbox{and} \quad \mu^-(E)=-\mu(B\cap E).\]
This definition is easily shown to be independent of the chosen Hahn decomposition. 

It is clear that $\mu^+$ is a positive measure, and it is called the \emph{positive variation} of $\mu$. On the other hand, $\mu^-$ is a positive finite measure, called the \emph{negative variation} of $\mu$. 
The measure $|\mu|=\mu^+ + \mu^-$ is called the \emph{total variation} of $\mu$.

Notice that $\mu = \mu^+ - \mu^-$. This decomposition of $\mu$ into its positive and negative parts is called the \emph{Jordan decomposition} of $\mu$.
