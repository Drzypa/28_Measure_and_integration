The projection of a measurable set from the product $X\times Y$ of two measurable spaces need not itself be measurable. See a Lebesgue measurable but non-Borel set for an example. However, the following result can be shown. The notation $\mathcal{F}\times\mathcal{B}$ refers to the \PMlinkname{product $\sigma$-algebra}{ProductSigmaAlgebra}.

\begin{theorem*}
Let $(X,\mathcal{F})$ be a measurable space and $Y$ be a Polish space with Borel $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{B}$.
Then the \PMlinkname{projection}{ProjectionMap} of any $S\in\mathcal{F}\times\mathcal{B}$ onto $X$ is universally measurable.
\end{theorem*}

In particular, if $\mathcal{F}$ is universally complete then the projection of $S$ will be in $\mathcal{F}$, and this applies to all complete \PMlinkname{$\sigma$-finite}{SigmaFinite} measure spaces $(X,\mathcal{F},\mu)$. For example, the projection of any Borel set in $\mathbb{R}^n$ onto $\mathbb{R}$ is Lebesgue measurable.

The theorem is a direct consequence of the properties of \PMlinkname{analytic sets}{AnalyticSet2}, following from the result that projections of analytic sets are analytic and the fact that \PMlinkname{analytic sets are universally measurable}{MeasurabilityOfAnalyticSets}.
Note, however, that the theorem itself does not refer at all to the concept of analytic sets.

The measurable projection theorem has important applications to the theory of continuous-time stochastic processes. For example, the d\'ebut theorem, which says that the first time at which a progressively measurable stochastic process enters a given measurable set is a stopping time, follows easily. 
Also, if $(X_t)_{t\in\mathbb{R}_+}$ is a jointly measurable process defined on a measurable space $(\Omega,\mathcal{F})$, then the maximum process $X^*_t=\sup_{s\le t}X_s$ will be universally measurable since,
\begin{equation*}
\left\{\omega\in\Omega\colon X^*_t> K\right\}
=\pi_\Omega\left(\left\{(s,\omega)\colon s\le t,\ X_s> K\right\}\right)
\end{equation*}
is universally measurable, where $\pi_\Omega\colon\Omega\times\mathbb{R}_+\to\Omega$ is the projection map.
Furthermore, this also shows that the topology of ucp convergence is well defined on the space of jointly measurable processes.
