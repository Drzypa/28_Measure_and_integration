A property of \PMlinkname{analytic sets}{AnalyticSet2} which makes them particularly suited to applications in measure theory is that, in common with \PMlinkname{$\sigma$-algebras}{SigmaAlgebra}, they are closed under countable unions and intersections.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:1}
Let $(X,\mathcal{F})$ be a paved space and $(A_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence of $\mathcal{F}$-analytic sets. Then, $\bigcup_nA_n$ and $\bigcap_n A_n$ are $\mathcal{F}$-analytic.
\end{theorem}

A consequence of this is that measurable sets are analytic, as follows.

\begin{corollary*}
Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a nonempty paving on a set $X$ such that the \PMlinkname{complement}{Complement} of any $S\in\mathcal{F}$ is a union of countably many sets in $\mathcal{F}$.

Then, every set $A$ in the $\sigma$-algebra generated by $\mathcal{F}$ is $\mathcal{F}$-analytic.
\end{corollary*}

For example, every closed subset of a metric space $X$ is a union of countably many open sets. Therefore, the corollary shows that all Borel sets are analytic with respect to the open subsets of $X$.

That the corollary does indeed follow from Theorem \ref{thm:1} is a simple application of the monotone class theorem.
First, as the collection $a(\mathcal{F})$ of $\mathcal{F}$-analytic sets is closed under countable unions and finite intersections, it will contain all finite unions of finite intersections of sets in $\mathcal{F}$ and their complements, which is an \PMlinkname{algebra}{RingOfSets}. Then, Theorem \ref{thm:1} says that $a(\mathcal{F})$ is closed under taking limits of increasing and decreasing sequences of sets. So, by the monotone class theorem, it contains the $\sigma$-algebra generated by $\mathcal{F}$.
