\begin{document}
Let $(X, \mathcal{B},\mu)$ be a measure space. A set $A \in \mathcal{B}$ is called an {\bf atom} if $A$ has positive measure and contains no measurable subsets $B \subset A$ such that $0 < \mu (B)< \mu(A)$.
 
An equivalent definition can be: $A$ has positive measure and for every measurable subset $B \subset A$, either $\mu(B)=0$ or $\mu(A-B)=0$.
