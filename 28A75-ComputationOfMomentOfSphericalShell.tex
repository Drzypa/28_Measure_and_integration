In using the formula for area integration over a sphere derived in the \PMlinkid{last example}{6668}, we need to keep in mind that to every point in $xy$ plane, there correspond two points on the sphere, which are obtained by taking the two signs of the square root.  The importance of this fact in obtaining a correct answer is illustrated by our next example, the calculation of the moment of inertia of a spherical shell.

The moment of a spherical shell is given by the integral
 $$I = \int_S x^2 \, d^2 A.$$
While we could compute this by first converting to spherical coordinates and then using the result of \PMlinkid{example 1}{6664}, we can avoid the trouble of changing coordinates by treating the sphere as a graph.  Using the result of the previous example, our integral becomes
 $$\int_S x^2 \, d^2 A = 2 \int_{x^2 + y^2 < r^2} \frac{r x^2}{\sqrt{ r^2 - x^2 - y^2 }} \, dx \, dy,$$
where the factor of 2 takes into account the observation of the preceding paragraph that two points of the sphere correspond to each point of the $xy$ plane.  Computing this integral, we find
 $$2 \int_{-r}^{+r} \int_{-\sqrt{r^2 - y^2}}^{+\sqrt{r^2 - y^2}} \frac{r x^2}{\sqrt{ r^2 - x^2 - y^2}} \, dx \, dy =$$
 $$2r \int_{-r}^{+r} \left( \left. -\frac{1}{2} x \sqrt{ r^2 - x^2 - y^2} + \frac{1}{2} (r^2 - y^2) \arcsin \frac{x}{\sqrt{ r^2 - y^2 }} \right) \right|_{-\sqrt{r^2 - y^2}}^{+\sqrt{r^2 - y^2}}  \, dy =$$
 $$2r \int_{-r}^{+r} \frac{\pi}{2} (r^2 - y^2) \, dy = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^4$$
