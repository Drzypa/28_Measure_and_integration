Let $(X,\mathcal{S},\mu)$ be a measure space, and let $E$ be a subset of $X$ of finite measure. If $f_n$ is a sequence of measurable functions converging to $f$ almost everywhere, then for each $\delta>0$ there exists a set $E_\delta$ such that $\mu(E_\delta)<\delta$ and $f_n\rightarrow f$ \PMlinkname{uniformly}{UniformConvergence} on $E-E_\delta$.
