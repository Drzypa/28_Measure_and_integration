\PMlinkname{Analytic subsets}{AnalyticSet2} of a measurable space $(X,\mathcal{F})$ do not, in general, have to be measurable. See, for example, \PMlinkname{a Lebesgue measurable but non-Borel set}{ALebesgueMeasurableButNonBorelSet}. However, the following result is true.

\begin{theorem*}
All analytic subsets of a measurable space are universally measurable.
\end{theorem*}

Therefore for a universally complete measurable space $(X,\mathcal{F})$ all $\mathcal{F}$-analytic sets are themselves in $\mathcal{F}$ and, in particular, this applies to any complete \PMlinkname{$\sigma$-finite measure space}{SigmaFinite} $(X,\mathcal{F},\mu)$. For example, analytic subsets of the real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ are Lebesgue measurable.

The proof of the theorem follows as a consequence of the capacitability theorem.
Suppose that $A$ is an $\mathcal{F}$-analytic set. Then, for any finite measure $\mu$ on $(X,\mathcal{F})$, let $\mu^*$ be the outer measure generated by $\mu$. This is an $\mathcal{F}$-capacity and, by the capacitability theorem, $A$ is $(\mathcal{F},\mu^*)$-capacitable, hence is in the completion of $\mathcal{F}$ with respect to $\mu$ (see \PMlinkname{capacity generated by a measure}{CapacityGeneratedByAMeasure}). As this is true for all such finite measures, $A$ is universally measurable.
