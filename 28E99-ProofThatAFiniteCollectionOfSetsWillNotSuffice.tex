\begin{document}
Suppose that you cut $[0,1]$ into $A_0,...,A_n$.
Displacing the parts is simply translating them; you can suppose
that you leave $A_0$ in place and translate all the others to the
right. Let $\epsilon$ be the smallest translation length : if after
translation the union contains $[0,1]$, necessarily $[0,\epsilon]
\subset A_0$. A contradiction ensues.
