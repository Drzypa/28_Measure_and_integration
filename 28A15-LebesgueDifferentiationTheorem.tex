Let $f$ be a locally integrable function on $\mathbb{R}^n$ with Lebesgue measure $m$, i.e. $f\in L^1_\textnormal{loc}(\mathbb{R}^n)$. \emph{Lebesgue's differentiation theorem} basically says that for almost every $x$, the averages 
\[\frac{1}{m(Q)}\int_Q |f(y)-f(x)|dy\]
converge to $0$ when $Q$ is a cube containing $x$ and $m(Q)\rightarrow 0$. 

Formally, this means that there is a set $N\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ with $\mu(N)=0$, such that for every $x\notin N$ and $\varepsilon>0$, there exists 
$\delta>0$ such that, for each cube $Q$ with $x\in Q$ and $m(Q)<\delta$, we have
\[\frac{1}{m(Q)}\int_Q|f(y)-f(x)|dy<\varepsilon.\]

For $n=1$, this can be restated as an analogue of the fundamental theorem of calculus for Lebesgue integrals. Given a $x_0\in \mathbb{R}$,
\[\frac{d}{dx}\int_{x_0}^x f(t)dt = f(x)\]
for almost every $x$.
