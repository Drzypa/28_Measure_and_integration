Let $(X,\mathfrak{B},\mu)$ be a measure space with $\mu$ the counting measure. If $f$ is an integrable function, $\displaystyle \int_X f\,d\mu<\infty$, then it has \PMlinkname{countable}{Countable} \PMlinkname{support}{Support6}.

\begin{proof}
WLOG, we assume that $f$ is real valued and is nonnegative. Let $S_0$ denote the preimage of the interval $[1,\infty)$ and, for every positive integer $n$, let $S_n$ denote the preimage of the interval $\left[\frac{1}{n+1},\frac{1}{n}\right)$. Since the integral of $f$ is bounded, each $S_n$ can be at most finite.  Taking the union of all the $S_n$, we get the support $\displaystyle \supp f = \bigcup_{n=0}^\infty S_n$.  Thus, $\supp f$ is a union of countably many finite sets and hence is countable.
