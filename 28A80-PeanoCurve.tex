A \emph{Peano curve} or \emph{space-filling curve} is a continuous mapping of a closed interval onto a square.  

Such mappings, introduced by Peano in 1890, played an
important role in the development of topology as a counterexample 
to the naive ideas of dimension --- while it is
true that one cannot map a space onto a space of higher dimension using a 
smooth map, this is no longer true if one only requires continuity as opposed to
smoothness.  The Peano curve and similar examples led to a rethinking of the foundations
of topology and analysis, and underscored the importance of formulating 
topological notions in a rigorous fashion.

However, still, a space-filling curve cannot ever be one-to-one;
otherwise invariance of dimension would be violated.

Many space-filling curves may be obtained as the limit of a sequence, $\langle \, h_n \mid n \in \mathbb{N} \, \rangle$, of continuous functions $h_n \colon \lbrack 0,1\rbrack \to \lbrack 0,1\rbrack \times \lbrack 0,1\rbrack$. Figure \ref{fig:graph} (\PMlinktofile{source code}{hilbert.cc}), showing the ranges of the first few approximations to Hilbert's space-filling curve, illustrates a common case in which each successive approximation is obtained by applying a recursive procedure to its predecessor.
